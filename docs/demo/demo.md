# Demo TOC

## Motivation

- The testing skill banner - nice image of a robot that jungles many things

- Problem 1: Tests became a scale issue, image: final-scale-issue.pngs #now
- Prompt & get report - executive summary + clean tests. Show the 10 first lines of the-test-verpifier.md, move with arrow on click on every line
- Problem 2: Let's prompt, "please please", It will fail for many reasons, image: failures #now1 flow-problems.png

- Mostly green color. Draw, or create react component that shows from From one end on the left side, a prompt, and on the most right side, production. And then it has multiple stations on the middle while there is a green strip. There are brown and green strips on that horizontal axis. Those are a few green and a few brown shapes overlapping an arrow moving through each station on click
