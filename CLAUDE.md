# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a work-in-progress project focused on setting up modern frontend testing infrastructure with best practices. The goal is to create an automated agent that installs and configures frontend testing tools and provides example tests demonstrating good testing practices.

## Current State

This project is in its early stages. The codebase structure, testing framework, and build configuration are not yet established.

## Development Setup

No package manager or build tools have been configured yet. When setting up this project, typical frontend testing tools to consider include:
- Testing frameworks (Vitest, Jest, Playwright, Cypress)
- Build tools (Vite, Webpack)
- Type checking (TypeScript)
- Linting and formatting tools

## Testing Best Practices

**⚠️ MANDATORY: When writing or modifying tests, you MUST follow all rules in [`example-app/testing-best-practices.md`](./example-app/testing-best-practices.md).** This file contains comprehensive testing guidelines that must be followed for all test code.

## Notes

This CLAUDE.md should be updated as the project structure and tooling are established.
