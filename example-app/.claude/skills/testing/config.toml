# Testing Skill Configuration
# This configuration controls the testing workflow behavior and system-specific settings.
# All commands and paths should be adjusted to match your project setup.

[workflow]
# When true, stops the workflow if no test plan (test-plan.md) is found before writing tests.
# This ensures tests are never written without a proper plan first.
stop_when_no_plan = true

# When true, stops the workflow if no app analysis (app-analysis.md) is found.
# App analysis captures runtime information like network calls that inform test writing.
stop_when_no_page_analysis = true

# When true, requires human review and approval of test plans before proceeding to code tests.
# Recommended for production workflows to ensure test coverage meets requirements.
must_have_human_review_of_plan = true

[framework]
# The test framework used for writing and running tests.
# Common values: "vitest", "jest", "playwright", "cypress"

# Library used for mocking functions, modules, and code-level dependencies.
# Common values: "vitest", "jest", "sinon"

# Library used for intercepting and mocking network requests.
# Common values: "msw", "nock", "cy.intercept"
network_interception_framework = "msw"

[commands]
# Command to start the application for testing/inspection.
# The app must be running for UI tests and page analysis.
app_start_command = "pnpm dev"

# Command to stop the application (optional).
# Set to empty string if app stops automatically or doesn't need explicit stopping.
# Useful for cleanup scripts or when running in CI.
app_stop_command = "pids=$(lsof -ti tcp:5173); [ -n '$pids' ] && kill -9 $pids"

# Command to run the test suite.
# This is the primary command used after writing tests to verify they pass.
test_run_command = "pnpm test"

# Command to stage changes for git.
git_stage_command = "git add -A"

[paths]
# Where to save test context artifacts (test plans, app analysis, etc.).
# Options:
#   - "given": A main agent, or a spec-driven framework, will provide an already existing path
#   - A custom path like "./test-context" or "./.claude/test-artifacts"

# This folder will contain: test-plan.md, app-analysis.md, test results, etc.

[app]
# The base URL of the frontend application or API
# Used for navigation during analysis and testing

[outputs]
# Filenames for the two output documents generated by the test-planner agent
