# Testing Skill Configuration
# This configuration controls the testing workflow behavior and system-specific settings.
# All commands and paths should be adjusted to match your project setup.

[workflow]
# When true, stops the workflow if no test plan (test-plan.md) is found before writing tests.
# This ensures tests are never written without a proper plan first.

# When true, stops the workflow if no app analysis (app-analysis.md) is found.
# App analysis captures runtime information like network calls that inform test writing.
stop_when_no_page_analysis = true

# When true, requires human review and approval of test plans before proceeding to code tests.
# Recommended for production workflows to ensure test coverage meets requirements.
